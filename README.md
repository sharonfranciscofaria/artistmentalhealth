<h1 align="center">The Creative Mind - An Artist Mental Health</h1>

## Problem 
As a person who had background in the creative industry as well as is surrounded by family members and friends who are artist / are in the crative industry, their mental health is often not taken seriously for several reasons:

 1- Stigma: Mental health issues are still stigmatized in many parts of the world, and artists may face additional stigma for admitting to mental health problems because it can be seen as a sign of weakness or instability.

 2- Lack of Awareness: Some people may not be aware of the unique challenges and stressors faced by artists, which can contribute to mental health problems.

 3- Limited Resources: Artists may face financial difficulties, and mental health resources may not be readily available or affordable for them.

 4- Misconceptions: There may be misconceptions about the relationship between mental health and artistic ability, leading some to believe that mental health problems are a necessary part of the creative process.

 5- It's important to recognize the challenges faced by artists and to provide support and resources to help them maintain good mental health.

## Solution and Purpose

## Designing the visual elements

### Google Fonts and Canva Brand Logo 

Throughout the whole website except the main heading of the homepage, the website mainly uses [Josefin Sans, Designed by Santiago Orozco](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans) with various font size and font weight. 

To offer the website's visitors a sense of artistic feel, the main homepage header font [Pinyon Script, Designed by Nicole Fally](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pinyon+Script) was chosen. It was carefully decided not to be used more frequently as it can be difficult for users to read. 

<h2 align="center"><img src="/workspace/artistmentalhealth/assets/docs/font-logo.jpg"></h2>

Different logo concepts were first created, but in the end, it felt that a simple text and straightforward logo best reflected the current professionalism and elegance of the brand. The font "Josefin Sans" was used to design the website, making it simple to adapt to various mediums and sizes. 

### Colour Palette

These  colours were chosen to give a soft and neutral colors that can create a calming and soothing atmosphere on a website. This can help reduce stress and anxiety for users, making the website more enjoyable to use. These colours also help the ability of reading text clearly on a website, making it easier for users to consume information and navigate the site.
