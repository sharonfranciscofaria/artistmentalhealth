## Problem 
Artists' mental health is often not taken seriously for various reasons:

 1- Stigma: Mental health issues are still stigmatized in many parts of the world, and artists may face additional stigma for admitting to mental health problems because it can be seen as a sign of weakness or instability.

 2- Lack of Awareness: Some people may not be aware of the unique challenges and stressors faced by artists, which can contribute to mental health problems.

 3- Limited Resources: Artists may face financial difficulties, and mental health resources may not be readily available or affordable for them.

 4- Misconceptions: There may be misconceptions about the relationship between mental health and artistic ability, leading some to believe that mental health problems are a necessary part of the creative process.

 5- It's important to recognize the challenges faced by artists and to provide support and resources to help them maintain good mental health.
